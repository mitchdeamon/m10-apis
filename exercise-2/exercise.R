### Exercise 2 ###

# As you noticed, it often takes multiple queries to retrieve the desired information.
# This is a perfect situation in which writing a function will allow you to better structure your
# code, and give a name to a repeated task.

# Write a function that allows you to specify an artist, and returns the top 10 tracks of that artist
artist <- function(art_name) {
  base <- 'https://play.spotify.com/artist/2gBjLmx6zQnFGQJCAQpRgw'
  search <- 'q='
  type <- '&type=artist'
  query.url <- paste0(base, search, type)
  data <- fromJSON(query.url)
  return(data)
}


# What are the top 10 tracks by Nelly?




### Bonus ### 
# Write a function that allows you to specify a search type (artist, album, etc.), and a string, 
# that returns the album/artist/etc. page of interest


# Search albums with the word "Sermon"
